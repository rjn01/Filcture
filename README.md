# Filcture :camera_flash:

## Description :receipt:

Filcture ​is a *​Deep learning*​ based *web application*.

It is designed to be used for adding style to the existing pictures using Deep Learning.
The Deep learning model is integrated using ​Flask ​as a backend framework which is built on Python and the frontend of the application is designed using ​HTML5​ , ​CSS3 ​and ​JavaScript 6​.

User upload the image and selects the style which is to be added on the image. Neural Style Transfer Algorithm is used for adding the style to the user's image and after processing the new styled image would be shown on the web page.

## Technologies Used :pen:

-   <mark>FrontEnd</mark>: Html5, Css3, ECMA6(JavaScript)
-   <mark>Backend</mark>: Flask
-   <mark>Machine Learning</mark>: Python, OpenCV
-   <mark>Deep Learning</mark>: Keras / Tensorflow
-   <mark>Deployment</mark>: Heroku (In Future)

# Future Scope :shipit:

In future, the users would be able to capture or process the image from the application itself in real time.
