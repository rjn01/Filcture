# Filcture

## Description

Filcture ​is a ​Machine learning ​and ​Deep learning​ based web application. It is designed to be used for adding filters to the existing pictures using various algorithms and models. We are using ​OpenCV ​for image processing. The project is also implementing the ​GAN ​model for generating new pictures. In future, the users would be able to capture or process the image from the application itself in real time. The machine learning model will be integrated using ​Flask ​as a backend framework which is built on Python. The frontend of the application will be designed using ​HTML5​ , ​CSS3 ​and ​JavaScript 6​.
